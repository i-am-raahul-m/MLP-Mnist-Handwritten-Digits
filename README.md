# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification with MLP

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is built, trained, tested, and used for predictions in a straightforward workflow, making it ideal for beginners and enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Dataset**: Uses the MNIST handwritten digits dataset (60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images).
- **Model Architecture**: A fully connected neural network (MLP) designed for digit classification.
- **Training**: Model is trained using standard supervised learning techniques.
- **Evaluation**: Achieves a reasonably high accuracy of (~98%) on the test dataset.
- **Prediction**: Can predict handwritten digits from custom input images.
